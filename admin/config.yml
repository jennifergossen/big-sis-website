# To use the CMS:
# 1. Deploy this site to Netlify
# 2. Go to Netlify > Site Settings > Identity > Enable Identity
# 3. Under Identity > Services, enable Git Gateway
# 4. Invite yourself as a user under Identity
# 5. Visit yoursite.netlify.app/admin/ to log in and edit content

# NOTE: Since this is a pure HTML site (no build step), the CMS edits
# files directly in the repo. After saving, changes are committed to
# GitHub and Netlify auto-redeploys. For HTML pages, you'll edit the
# raw file content — look for the sections marked with comments.
#
# For a more visual editing experience in the future, consider migrating
# to a static site generator (e.g. Eleventy) that can use markdown files.
